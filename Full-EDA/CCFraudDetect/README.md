## Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
In this project i decided to take on a Credit Card Fraud dataset to develop a simple Tensorflow model to detect frauds.
The particularity of this dataset is that it was very unbalanced.
In this dataset, i decided to use a simple LOF method, instead of the usual IQR method to detect outliers, just to see any differences against a very popular Kaggle Notebook i mentioned in the ipynb file.
